    <p>The right way to make scrambled eggs require more than just mixing and cooking eggs. But the secret to great and fluffy scrambled eggs requires good attention and proper techniques. The total cook time of this recipe is six minutes and yields one serving per batch.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.</li>
    </ol>
