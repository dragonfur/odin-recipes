    <p>This family-friendly dinner of slow-cooked sweet and sour chicken thighs can be made really easily, and it is especially nice cooked with rice. The prep time for 10 minutes, with a total cook time of four hours and ten minutes. Each batch will yield about six servings.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 (20 ounce) can pineapple chunks in juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Steps
        <li>Mix 2 tablespoons cornstarch, garlic powder, and ground ginger together in a small bowl. Toss chicken thighs in cornstarch mixture until they are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook chicken in the skillet until browned on all sides, 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain juice from the can of pineapple chunks into a measuring cup. You should have approximately 3/4 cup to 1 cup of juice.</li>
        <li>Mix 1/2 cup pineapple juice, chicken stock, rice vinegar, brown sugar, ketchup, and soy sauce together in a slow cooker. Add browned chicken pieces and stir to coat chicken with the sauce. Cook on Low for 3 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Whisk remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch with remaining 1/4 cup pineapple juice. Stir cornstarch mixture into the slow cooker. Increase the slow cooker heat to High and add pineapple chunks and chopped red bell pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook on High until the sauce is bubbly and thickened and bell pepper is crisp-tender, about 30 minutes. Garnish with chopped green onion.</li>
    </ol>
